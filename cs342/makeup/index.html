    </header>

    <p>In this homework, we will look at character-level language models. These models
take a sequence of characters as input and predict the next character.</p>
<p>This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed
individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students.
See details at the bottom of this page.</p>
<h1 id="starter-code-and-data">Starter Code and Data</h1>
<p>Starter code for this assignment is available <a href="https://gavlegoat.github.io/cs342-homeworks/extra.zip">here</a>.
The starter code zip for this assignment includes the dataset you will need.</p>
<p>For this assignment, we will use the transcripts of several speeches by Barack
Obama. (We chose Obama because there are more publicly available speech
transcripts than other presidents.) We&rsquo;ll be using a simplified character set
consisting of only 26 letters (we do not distinguish between capital and
lower-case letters), space and period.</p>
<p>Inside <code>models.py</code> you will find the <code>LanguageModel</code> class. This is an abstract
class representing the language modeling functionality you will be developing.
Our language models work by predicting 28 probabilities &ndash; one for each
character in our reduced character set. Effectively, the language model is a
classifier over our character set. The <code>LanguageModel</code> class has two methods:
<code>predict_all</code> takes a string <code>s</code> of length <code>n</code> and predicts the next character
for each substring <code>s[:i]</code> for <code>i</code> from 0 to <code>n</code>. Note that this includes
predicting next characters for the empty string <code>''</code> and the whole string <code>s</code>,
so this method should return <code>n+1</code> values. The <code>predict_next</code> method takes a
string and predicts just the next character for the entire string. This method
is already implemented and it just calls <code>predict_all</code>.</p>
<p>As a first step, the starter code includes a fully-implemented
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">Bigram</a> model as well as an adjacent
language model which favors characters which are close in the alphabet to the
current character. These models provide baselines you can compare your network
to and test your work.</p>
<p>You will also find <code>utils.py</code> which includes some useful functionality. The
<code>SpeechDataset</code> class loads the speech data and the <code>one_hot</code> function converts
a string into a one-hot encoding of characters with shape <code>(28, len(s))</code>. You
can create a one-hot encoded dataset by calling
<code>SpeechDataset('data/train.txt', transform=one_hot)</code>.</p>
<p>The parts of this homework are largely indpendent, so feel free to skip around
and do things in whatever order you like.</p>
<h1 id="log-likelihood-of-text-10-pts">Log-likelihood of Text (10 pts)</h1>
<p>In this section, you will implement <code>log_likelihood</code> in <code>language.py</code>. This
function should take a model and a string as input and return the probability
of generating that string under that model. You can use <code>Bigram</code> or
<code>AdjacentLanguageModel</code> to test your function:</p>
<pre><code>python -m homework.language -m Bigram
</code></pre>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that the language model can take an empty string as input.</li>
<li>Remember that the model&rsquo;s <code>predict_all</code> method will return the
log-probabilities of the next character of each prefix of the string.</li>
<li>The log-likelihood is the <em>sum</em> of the log-likelihoods of each individual
character, not the average or the product.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="generating-text-10-pts">Generating Text (10 pts)</h1>
<p>Now, we will implement <code>sample_random</code> in <code>language.py</code>. This function takes a
language model as input and generates a string by repeatedly sampling according
to the distribution generated by the model. (This is what we called &ldquo;sequential
sampling&rdquo; in class.) The model should stop generating when <code>max_length</code>
characters are produced or if the model produces a period.</p>
<p>Hint: take a look at <code>torch.distributions</code> for some useful functionality
related to sampling from distributions. The <code>Categorical</code> class may be
particularly useful.</p>
<p>Note that the text you generate may not look very good. Here is one output
sampled from the temporal convolutional network in the master solution: &ldquo;some
of a backnown my but or the understand thats why weve hardships not around work
since there one they will be begin with consider daughters some as more a new
but jig go atkeeral westedly.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="beam-search-20-pts">Beam Search (20 pts)</h1>
<p>Here we will implement a beam search in the <code>beam_search</code> function in
<code>language.py</code>. Once again, the search terminates if the sequence reaches
<code>max_length</code> characters or if a period is generated. The beam search should
keep the top <code>beam_size</code> results at each step, and return the top <code>n_results</code>
sequences at the end of the search. Sequences should be scored on one of two
criteria: their overall log-likelihood (as in <code>log_likelihood</code>) if
<code>average_log_likelihood=False</code> or the average per-character log likelihood if
<code>average_log_likelihood=True</code>. In general, the per-character average will
result in longer sequences while the overall log-likelihood will terminate
after a relatively small number of words.</p>
<p>Hint: Inside <code>language.py</code> you will find <code>TopNHeap</code>. This class will be useful
to keep track of the best sequences during your search. Here are a coupl of
samples from the master solution with <code>average_log_likelihood=False</code>:</p>
<pre><code>thats.

</code></pre>
<p>And here are a few with <code>average_log_likelihood=True</code>:</p>
<pre><code>and we will continue to make sure that we will continue to the united states of american.
and we will continue to make sure that we will continue to the united states of the united states.
and we will continue to make sure that we will continue to the united states of america.
and thats why were going to make sure that will continue to the united states of america.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="temporal-convolutional-model-20-pts">Temporal Convolutional Model (20 pts)</h1>
<p>In this section you will define a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to use
for language modeling. For this, you will need to first define the
<code>CausalConv1dBlock</code>, which combines a causal convolution with a nonlinearity.
The main <code>TCN</code> function should use a stack of causal blocks with dilation to
build a complete model. At the end of the model, you&rsquo;ll want to add a
convolutional layer with a window size of 1 to produce the output. Then
<code>TCN.predict_all</code> should use <code>TCN.forward</code> to predict the log-probabilies for
an input sequence.</p>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>TCN.forward</code> works with batches of data.</li>
<li>Make sure <code>TCN.predict_all</code> returns log-probabilities, <em>not</em> logits.</li>
<li>Store the distribution over the first character in the sentence as a
parameter of the model using <code>torch.nn.Parameter</code>.</li>
<li>Try to keep the model relatively small. The master solution takes about 15
minutes to train on a pretty good GPU. Yours make take a little longer, but
it shouldn&rsquo;t need hours of training.</li>
<li>Try adding a residual connection to the block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant documentation:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ConstantPad1d.html#torch.nn.ConstantPad1d">torch.nn.ConstantPad1d</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tcn-training-40-pts">TCN Training (40 pts)</h1>
<p>Train your TCN using <code>train.py</code>. You may want to reuse some training code from
previous assignments.</p>
<p>Hint: You may find SGD works better than Adam in this case, but you may also
need a large learning rate (around 0.1).</p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>The validation grader can be run with</p>
<pre><code>python -m grader homework -v
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this grader is using a different set of test data than we use for our
grader, so there may be some difference between the two. The distributions will
be the same so your grade should be similar between the two graders, unless the
model is massively overfit to the validation set.</p>
<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<p>Once you are ready to submit, create a bundle by running</p>
<pre><code>python bundle.py homework &lt;eid&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>then submit the resulting zip file on Canvas. Note that the grader has a
maximum file size limit of 20MB. You shouldn&rsquo;t run into this limit unless your
models are much larger than they need to be. You can check that your homework
was bundled properly by grading it again with</p>
<pre><code>python -m grader &lt;eid&gt;.zip
</code></pre>
<h1 id="online-grader">Online Grader</h1>
<p>The online grading system uses a slightly modified version of Python, so please
make sure your code follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use <code>exit</code> or <code>sys.exit</code> as this will likely crash the grader.</li>
<li>Do not try to access files except for the ones provided with the homework zip
file. Writing files is disabled.</li>
<li>Network access is disabled in the grader. Make sure you are reading your
dataset from the <code>data</code> folder rather than from a network connection
somewhere.</li>
<li>Do not fork or spawn new processes.</li>
<li><code>print</code> and <code>sys.stdout.write</code> are ignored by the grader.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h1>
<p>You should do this homework individually. You are allowed to discuss high-level
ideas and general structure with each other, but not specific details about
code, architecture, or hyperparameters. You may consult online sources, but
don&rsquo;t copy code directly from any posts you find. Cite any ideas you take from
online sources in your code (include the full URL where you found the idea).
You may refer to your own solutions or the master solutions to prior homework
assignments from this class as well as any iPython notebooks from this class.
<strong>Do not put your solution in a public place (e.g., a public GitHub repo)</strong>.</p>
