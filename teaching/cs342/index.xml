      <description>In this project, you will implement an agent that plays the SuperTuxKart ice hockey game mode. You have two options for how to do this: an image-based agent or a state-based agent.
Regardless of which agent you choose, your goal is to train the agent to score as many goals as possible in a 2 vs. 2 tournament against some existing agents.
Note: In contrast to previous homeworks, you may work in groups of up to four students on this assignment.</description>

      <description>In this homework, we will look at character-level language models. These models take a sequence of characters as input and predict the next character.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students. See details at the bottom of this page.
Starter Code and Data Starter code for this assignment is available here. The starter code zip for this assignment includes the dataset you will need.</description>

      <description>In this homework, we will implement a neural vision system for an autonomous driving agent in SuperTuxKart.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students. See details at the bottom of this page.
Setup and Starter Code Starter code for this assignment is provided here. For this assignment, you will also need to install python bindings for SuperTuxKart &amp;ndash; these are available in the pip package PySuperTuxKart.</description>

      <description>In this homework, we will implement an object detector for the SuperTuxKart simulator. The goal is to look at an image and identify the locations of karts, bombs/projectiles, and pickup items. The dataset is the same as homework 3 and the starting code will look similar. You will need similar data augmentation to what you used in homework 3.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students.</description>

      <description>For this homework, we will really tune our SuperTuxKart classifier in order to push the accuracy as high as possible. We will then extend that classifier to label each pixel of the input rather than each input image as a whole.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students. See details at the bottom of this page.</description>

      <description>For this homework, you will be classifying images from the SuperTuxKart dataset using a convolutional neural network.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students. See details at the bottom of this page.
Starter Code We provide some starter code for this homework here. This zip file contains the following:

      <guid>https://gavlegoat.github.io/teaching/cs342/homework1/</guid>
      <description>In this first homework, you will be training a deep network to classify images from SuperTuxKart.
This assignment, as with all of the homework assignments, should be completed individually without sharing solutions, models, or ideas with other students. See details at the bottom of this page.
Running on Google Colab For this assignment, as well as future assignments, you may want access to a GPU to train your models more quickly.</description>
